<h4><font face="Arial">Introduction - registration and logging in</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">Part of the Araucaria project is the creation and 
maintenance of a database of arguments. To access this database, you will need 
to register with the server by providing a username, along with your (real) 
name, address and email address. None of this information is released to third 
parties. To register, select the Register command from this menu.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Once you have registered, you will need to login each time 
you wish to access the database. Select the Login command, and enter your 
username (there is no password) in the dialog. If login is successful, you will 
see a message to that effect in the status bar at the bottom of the main 
Araucaria window. If you are unable to login, this could be because you have not 
yet registered, you have not spelled your username correctly, your internet 
connection is not working, or the server in Dundee is down temporarily. If you 
are certain you have entered your username correctly, try later and the server 
should be back up and running.</font></p>
<BR><HR>
<h4><font face="Arial">Save to database (Ctrl + B) </font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">The current argument, along with a JPEG image of the 
diagram, will be saved to the database. You must be registered and logged in for 
this command to succeed. <b>Note that you cannot delete items from the database 
yourself, so please be certain you really want to save the argument before 
selecting this command.</b> Remember that saved arguments are accessible to all 
users of the database.</font></p>
<br>
<h4><font face="Arial">Search database (Ctrl + V) </font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">Opens the &quot;Search argument database&quot; dialog box. You may 
search the database in three ways:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial">By text - select the 'Text' tab. Enter a word or phrase 
  and the text associated with each argument will be searched.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">By structure - select the 'Structure' tab. Create an 
  argument tree in the same way as on the main Araucaria window (except that you 
  do not need to select any text to associate with each node - just click in the 
  empty space on the diagram window to create a node). Any database entry 
  containing the given structure as part of its own structure will be returned.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">By schemeset - select the 'Schemeset' tab. Type in the 
  name of the scheme. Any arguments containing that scheme will be returned.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Arial">The results of the search will be displayed as a table in 
the Search dialog box, and also in the drop-down combo box near the right-hand 
side of the toolbar in the main Araucaria window. Selecting one of these 
arguments with the mouse (either in the Search dialog box or in the main window) 
will retrieve it from the database and load it into the main Araucaria window. 
You can then edit the argument further, and save it to disk on your local 
machine, or save it to the database as a new entry.</font></p>
